# Longitudinal Variational Autoencoders 

This repo proposes a framework to evaluate longitudinal evolution of imaging data with a mixed effect model. 
The goal is to both recover the population-average trajectory and the individual variations to this 
mean trajectory for each individual in order to best reconstruct the trajectories. 

Based on the article [Progression models for imaging data using longitudinal autoencoders](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03701632/document).
